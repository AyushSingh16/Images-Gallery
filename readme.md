# Images Gallery

Hello there! This is a basic project in which I tried to develop a website containing multiple images. The main aim of this project is to demonstrate a good understanding of various CSS concepts like Flex-box, Animations , Transitions ,etc. along with responsiveness. This website is built using HTML & CSS only.

# Features

This website includes several images aligned one after another. On hovering the color of the particular image gets changed and the image also gets scaled a bit and on stretching or squeezing the webpage, images will get stretched or squeezed with any issue.

# Getting Started

To run this website locally, you can follow these steps:

1) Clone this repository into your local machine. 
2) Open the index.html file into a code editor like VS Code. 
3) Modify the HTML & CSS file if you want.
4) Run it on Live Server.
